# An example using Dash applications within Django

This example utilizes [django-plotly-dash](https://django-plotly-dash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to place Dash apps within a Django app deployed on Heroku. I used a modified [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) to demonstrate how to make a dashboard look more personalized. The data used in this example came from another one of my projects which can be found [here](https://github.com/xxristoskk/2020-election-analysis).

Head to the [Heroku app](https://testingtw33typy.herokuapp.com/) to see it all in action.
